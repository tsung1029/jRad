jRad is originally developed by Joana Martins of IST and is used to post-process OSIRIS track data to generate the radiation patterns
from relativistic particles either from plasma based accelerators or other HED scenarios.  The original reference can be found here:

Currently I am maintaining it and will document this repo as time progresses.
